## Tiles Screen Saver

A little demo I mocked up awhile back.

## Features

# Randomized Colors & Refresh Time

Colors are generated randomly, but allows you to refresh those colors with a max time in ms.

# Grid View

Increase (or decrease) the number of rows and columns to your liking.

## A Demo:
